i dont really know what the website is gonna be about yet
but i hope its something cool, my main idea focuses around
a prank website where nothing you click is what it appears 
to me, so satire pretty much. I have another idea, basically
clicking websites that will ask for your age, if your age
is below 18 it will take you to a cool game website, if it is
above 18 then it will take you to a seperate brower, and if 
you enter a series of code, something complicated, like 492i4DJ
it would take you to a secret browser, idk yet but it's just
like, very cool idea. this website will be like a lockerroom and 
people can store things in here and open it with code. so there
wouldnt be username or logins, as long as you have your own unique
code, and info, you get access to this certain document. so ig its 
somewhat confidential.
